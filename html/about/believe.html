    The statement encapsulates the fundamental beliefs and practices of a Christian community. It affirms faith in Jesus Christ as Savior, the<br>
    authority of the Bible, and the Trinitarian concept of God. It acknowledges humanity's creation in holiness, subsequent fall into sin, and<br>
    the necessity of salvation through God's grace. The community emphasizes the offer of salvation to all through repentance and faith,<br>
    guided by the Holy Spirit. Belief in God's sovereignty in salvation and sanctification is upheld, alongside the continuous presence of<br>
    spiritual gifts and fruits. The local church is defined as a fellowship of baptized believers, engaging in practices such as baptism by<br>
    immersion and the Lord's Supper. Additionally, members are encouraged to practice tithing and voluntary giving to support the church's<br>
    mission. The observance of Sunday as the Lord's Day for worship is emphasized, as is submission to civil authorities in accordance with biblical<br>
    principles. There is a clear distinction between the saved and unsaved, and an anticipation of Christ's return and final judgment.<br>
    The community also acknowledges divine healing while affirming the use of medical treatment when necessary.
